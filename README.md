# What is this project?

This project is something I am working on as a part of Hackclub Campfire Flagship. My aim is for this project to allow me to gain experience in coding with PyGame and vector-based movement.


# The Game Premise

The game will be a simple dropper/platformer style. The player is a squirrel that must traverse down dense branches and reach the bottom without falling behind or moving on past the screen. On the way, there are coins and acorns to collect. Challenge your friends with your own maps with the map builder. The game is designed for players to make their own maps.


# How to use the map builder

The keybinds for the map builder are as follows:

    W,S Mousewheel and trackpad to scroll
    Q to chnage tile type to platform
    E = air tile
    C = coin
    X = Acorn
    F = Finish block
    T = Spawn
    Crtl+R = reset map


# How to play

Keybinds for player are as follows:

    P to play (on menu)
    A and D for movement left and right.
    W to jump
    Space to glide. This slows down players fall.
    ESCAPE to quit game


# How to download

Simply download the zip file and open it as a project in VSCode, PyCharm etc. Or, visit https://its-emora.itch.io/squirrel-fall
